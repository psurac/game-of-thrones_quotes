#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/ORCGXbDzi_A
#### Description:
In GOT Quotes, I use an API to get Quotes from Game of Thrones Charakters and additional Inforamtions like the Houses and there Members.
In the Project I made with javascript and SCSS and a bit of HTML a front-end interface to show this informations in a simple and estatic way. It is possible to click on the Quotes and Charakters as well on there Houses. You can get more mebmers or other Quotes and you can switsch in between. Most of that navigation is in a Popup window. The main Navigation starts giving you one Character of Game of Thrones with a single Quote, randomly chosen. Than it is possible to get a list of the Houses and a List of the Characters, you have a searchfiled to search in that lists. And at least you can get a a rendom list of 5 Characters with a single random quote.
Have fun by exploring GOT Quotes.
